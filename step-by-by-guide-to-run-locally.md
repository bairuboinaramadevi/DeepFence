# Running Your Application Locally

This guide provides instructions on how to set up and run this application on your local machine, specifically tailored for **VS Code**, **Python**, and **SQLiteDB**.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* **Git:** For cloning the repository.
    * [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* **Python & pip:** The programming language and its package installer.
    * [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* **VS Code:** Your integrated development environment (IDE).
    * [Download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
* **SQLite:** This application uses SQLite, which is a file-based database. No separate server installation is typically required as it's often bundled with Python or managed by your framework (e.g., Django, Flask).

### Recommended VS Code Extensions:

For a better development experience in VS Code, consider installing these extensions:

* **Python:** Provides rich support for Python development (linting, debugging, IntelliSense).
* **SQLite:** (e.g., "SQLite" by alexcvzz) Allows you to browse and manage SQLite databases directly within VS Code.
