🚀🛡️ Deploying DeepFence to Cloud Run from VS Code
🔐 Google Cloud Auth + 🔥 Firebase Integration

✅ Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure the following are in place:

Requirement	Description
🏦 Google Cloud Account	Billing enabled and Cloud Run API activated
💻 VS Code	With Cloud Code Extension
🐳 Docker Installed	For local builds (optional if using Cloud Buildpacks)
📦 Your Project Code	Contains a Dockerfile or is auto-buildable via Buildpacks
🔥 Firebase Project	Initialized with service account key downloaded
🔐 Firebase Admin SDK	Installed and integrated into your app code

1️⃣ Authenticate VS Code with Google Cloud
Open Visual Studio Code

Click the Google Cloud icon in the sidebar (Cloud Code)

Click ➕ Sign in to Google Cloud

Complete browser-based login flow

✅ Confirm active project at bottom-left status bar

2️⃣ Prepare Your Application (Cloud Run + Firebase Ready)
✔️ Requirements
Your app must listen on port 8080

Must have a Dockerfile or support Cloud Buildpacks

🔥 Firebase Integration (Python Example)
➤ Install Firebase Admin SDK
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install firebase-admin
➤ Initialize Firebase in Code
python
Copy
Edit
import firebase_admin
from firebase_admin import credentials, firestore

cred = credentials.Certificate("path/to/serviceAccountKey.json")
firebase_admin.initialize_app(cred)
db = firestore.client()

# Example: Store scan results
db.collection("deepfence-results").add({"result": "secure"})
🔐 Secure Credentials
✅ Copy service account key inside Dockerfile (not recommended)

🌿 Prefer environment variables or Google Secret Manager for production

3️⃣ Deploy to Cloud Run from VS Code
📦 Deployment Steps
Open Cloud Code Sidebar in VS Code

Right-click your project folder or use Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P)

Search:

mathematica
Copy
Edit
Cloud Run: Deploy to Cloud Run
🧭 Follow the prompts:

Select GCP project

Choose or create a Cloud Run service

Pick a region

Choose source: Dockerfile or Cloud Buildpacks

Set environment variables like:

bash
Copy
Edit
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/app/keys/firebase-key.json
Choose access level: Allow unauthenticated?

✅ VS Code builds → pushes → deploys your app to Cloud Run automatically!

4️⃣ Monitor Deployment & Access Your App
🛠️ Watch the Output window for build logs

🌐 After deployment, copy or click the Cloud Run URL

🔍 Paste it in your browser to verify your app is live

5️⃣ 🔐 Manage Secrets Securely
Never hardcode Firebase credentials or API keys.

✅ Recommended Approaches:
🌿 Environment variables

🔐 Google Secret Manager

bash
Copy
Edit
gcloud secrets create firebase-key \
  --data-file="path/to/serviceAccountKey.json"
Use Cloud Code or gcloud to mount secrets into Cloud Run securely.

6️⃣ 🔥 Firebase as Backend Database
Your deployed app can now:

✅ Store DeepFence scan results to Firestore or Realtime DB

📈 Retrieve logs or summaries

🔄 Enable dashboard workflows and visualizations

🔄 Redeploying & Updating
Make your code changes and repeat:

bash
Copy
Edit
Cloud Run: Deploy to Cloud Run
🧠 Cloud Code will handle image build and deployment automatically.

📝 Tips & Debugging
Tool	Use Case
🔭 Cloud Run Explorer	View deployed services, open logs & URLs
📊 Firebase Console	Monitor data writes, auth rules, analytics
🧾 Output Logs	Watch deployment status and error traces
