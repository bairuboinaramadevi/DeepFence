üöÄüõ°Ô∏è Deploying DeepFence to Cloud Run from VS Code (with Google Cloud Authentication & Firebase Database)
‚úÖ Prerequisites
Google Cloud account with billing enabled

Cloud Run API enabled on your project

VS Code installed

Cloud Code extension for VS Code installed

Docker installed (for local builds)

Your project code (with Dockerfile, or use Cloud Buildpacks for auto-containerization)

Firebase project set up and Firebase Admin SDK integrated in your application code for database access

1Ô∏è‚É£ Authenticate VS Code with Google Cloud
Open VS Code.

Open the Cloud Code extension sidebar (Google Cloud icon).

Click Sign in to Google Cloud.

Follow the prompts to authenticate your Google account and select your GCP project.

Ensure the correct project is active in the Cloud Code status bar at the bottom of VS Code.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Prepare Your Application (with Firebase Integration)
Ensure your app is ready for Cloud Run (listens on port 8080, has a Dockerfile or compatible entrypoint).

In your application code, integrate Firebase as your database:

Install the Firebase Admin SDK (pip install firebase-admin for Python, npm install firebase-admin for Node.js).

Initialize Firebase in your app using your service account credentials (download from the Firebase Console).

Use Firestore or Realtime Database to read/write data as needed.

Example (Python):

python
import firebase_admin
from firebase_admin import credentials, firestore

cred = credentials.Certificate('path/to/serviceAccountKey.json')
firebase_admin.initialize_app(cred)
db = firestore.client()
# Example: db.collection('deepfence-results').add({'result': 'secure'})
Make sure your Dockerfile copies the service account key or configure it securely via environment variables or Secret Manager.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Deploy to Cloud Run from VS Code
In the Cloud Code sidebar, right-click your project folder or open the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P).

Type and select Cloud Run: Deploy to Cloud Run.

Follow the prompts:

Select your Google Cloud project.

Choose or create a Cloud Run service.

Select the region.

Choose your container image source (Dockerfile or Buildpacks).

Set environment variables (such as GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS for Firebase).

Choose whether to allow unauthenticated access.

Cloud Code will build, push, and deploy your container to Cloud Run automatically.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Monitor Deployment and Access Your Service
Watch the Output window in VS Code for deployment logs and status.

Once deployed, the service URL will be displayed in the output.

Click the link or copy-paste it into your browser to verify your app is running live on Cloud Run.

5Ô∏è‚É£ (Optional) Manage Secrets Securely
Use the Cloud Code Secret Manager integration or environment variables to securely manage your Firebase service account credentials and API keys.

Never hardcode secrets in your source code.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Using Firebase as Your Database
Your deployed Cloud Run service can now read/write data to Firebase Firestore or Realtime Database as part of its workflow.

For example, DeepFence scan results, logs, or user data can be stored and retrieved from Firebase for reporting or further processing.

üîÑ Redeploying and Updating
Make code changes as needed.

Repeat the Cloud Run: Deploy to Cloud Run command to rebuild and redeploy your service.

üìù Tips
Use the Cloud Run Explorer in VS Code to view logs, manage services, and open URLs.

Use Firebase Console to monitor your database, security rules, and real-time data.

For troubleshooting, check the Output window and Cloud Run logs.
